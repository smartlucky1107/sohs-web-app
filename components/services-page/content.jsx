          In Hospitals or larger hospital systems may provide their own
          ambulance service as a service to the community, or where ambulance
          care is unreliable or chargeable. Many hospitalâ€¢based EMS departments
          operate solely with their hospital The physicians will attempt to
          treat casualties at the scene and will only transport them to hospital
          if it is deemed necessary. If patients are transported to hospital,
          they are more likely to go straight to a ward rather than to an
          emergency department. Countries that use this model include Austria,
          France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, Brazil and Chile.
